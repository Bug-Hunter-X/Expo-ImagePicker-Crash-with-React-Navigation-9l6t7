The core issue stems from improper handling of asynchronous operations and component lifecycle within the react-navigation context. To fix this, we need to ensure that the `ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync` function's result is handled correctly, preventing race conditions or situations where components are unmounted before the result is available.  This can be achieved by using useEffect hook to manage the asynchronous operation and checking if the component is mounted before updating the state. Here's an example of a corrected component:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import * as ImagePicker from 'expo-image-picker';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState(null);
  const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => setIsMounted(false);
  }, []);

  const pickImage = async () => {
    let result = await ImagePicker.launchImageLibraryAsync({
      mediaTypes: ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,
      allowsEditing: true,
      aspect: [4, 3],
      quality: 1,
    });

    if (!result.cancelled && isMounted) {
      setSelectedImage(result.uri);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Pick an image from camera roll" onPress={pickImage} />
      {selectedImage && <Image source={{ uri: selectedImage }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />}
    </View>
  );
};
export default MyComponent;
```
This improved solution uses a state variable `isMounted` to safely check if the component is still mounted before updating the state with the selected image. This prevents potential errors and ensures stable behavior.
