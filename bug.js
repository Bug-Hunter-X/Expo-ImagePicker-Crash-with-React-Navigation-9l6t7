This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library in conjunction with the react-navigation library.  Specifically, when selecting an image from the device's gallery within a screen navigated to using react-navigation, the app crashes or exhibits unexpected behavior. The error message is often vague or unhelpful, such as a generic 'TypeError' or 'undefined is not an object' error.
